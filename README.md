This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Elixir's `Enum.each` function when combined with asynchronous operations such as `Process.sleep`. The bug is that the order of execution within the `Enum.each` loop is not guaranteed to be sequential when an asynchronous operation is performed inside the loop.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues, especially in concurrent programs.  The solution shows a way to maintain the order of execution using tasks and `Task.await_many`.
